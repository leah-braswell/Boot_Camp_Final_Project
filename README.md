#  FSA Score Predictor

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict Third, Fourth, and Fifth Grade Achievement Levels on the Florida Standards Assessment (FSA) in ELA (English Lanugage Arts) and Math.  The FSA is a high-stakes test that is used to determine teacher ratings, school grades, Third Grade promotion requirements, and graduation eligibility.  Florida teachers spend a great deal of time using data to drive their instruction.  Educators provide targeted interventions that close learning gaps to ensure students achieve proficiency of grade level standards.  This model will use historical diagnostic data as well as demographics, attendance, and discipline data to predict student achievement on the FSA.  The analysis of this data will provide insight as to which factors impact performance on the assessment.  Schools will be able to use this model to predict achievement levels and prepare their staff and students for success.

## Team Communication Protocols
Team members have agreed to communicate primarily through slack on a day to day basis.  We will meet via Zoom on Tuesdays and Thursdays during/after regularly scheduled class time.  Should the need arise for an interim face-to-face, a Zoom will be scheduled.  During our Zoom meetings, team members will check progress on agreed upon tasks, delegate backlogged tasks, compare deliverables agains the rubric, and decide on next steps.  Each team member will have their own branch on the Git repository and require approval from other members before merging to the main branch.  The team will use GitHub projects and issues for project management.
