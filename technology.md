# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. We will perform the analysis within Jupyter Notebook. Also, we will be using libraries such as Numpy for statistical and mathematical operations and Matplotlib to create charts for the analysis. 

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use. PostgreSQL is lightweight, easy to install, easy to move around and open source DataBase. We will integrate Flask to display the data. 

## Machine Learning
Random Forest classifier is the model to use. The Random Forest model can predict with accuracy on large tabular data with less code and faster performance. Random Forest models' output and feature selection are easy to interpret, and they can easily handle outliers and nonlinear data. 

## Dashboard
- We will be using Tableau to display the dashboard with visualizations. We will integrate the dashboards into HTML page and will publish it through Github pages. 
- The interactive elemnts will be demographics such as ethnicity and gender. The user will be able to interact seeing how is the behavior in the FSA results by chosing between diferent etnicity or gender.
