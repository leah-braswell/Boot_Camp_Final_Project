# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. We will perform the analysis within Jupyter Notebook. Also, we will be using libraries such as Numpy for statistical and mathematical operations and Matplotlib to create charts for the analysis. 

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
Random Forest classifiers is the model to use. 

## Dashboard
We will be using bootsrap and HTML/CSS to display a dashboard with visualizations.
